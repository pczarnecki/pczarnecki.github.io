                        Comparison of spectrally-integrated pre-industrial to present-day CFC-12 forcing in CFC-12 only atmospheres. Atmospheric conditions (temperature profiles) are taken from the March 1981 mean in ERA5. In panel <b>a)</b>, the model forcing is shown. Panel <b>b)</b> shows the corresponding line-by-line forcing. Finally, panel <b>c)</b> shows the zonal means of the model (red) and LBL (black) for easy direct comparison.

                        Optically-thin greenhouse gases such as the ozone-depleting substances don't cool to space within the atmosphere, yet they still exert a sizeable radiative forcing. In this ongoing work, we extend an existing paper-and-pencil approach to CO2 radiative forcing in order to study radiative forcing by optically-thin gases, such as CFC-11 and -12, and gases that are not as optically thick as CO2, such as N2O and methane.

                    Below an example of a spectrum of outgoing longwave radiation, major absorbers are noted. Dots mark the members of three independent, optimal wavenumber subsets. The colors correspond to these independent optimizations. The size of the dots is proportional to the importance of that spectral point to the broadband flux integration.

                        Integrating radiative flux across the electromagnetic spectrum, though integral to weather and climate modelling, is computationally expensive; existing parameterizations are fast and accurate but are difficult to understand and implement. As an alternative, we propose Data-Driven Quadrature: we optimize a small set of spectral points and associated weights so that the weighted sum of the monochromatic flux at these points is equal to the total integrated flux. Our method can accurately reproduce flux and heating rate profiles in present-day conditions and radiative forcing by CO2 in the longwave. We are extending the method to the shortwave as well as variability by a wide range of greenhouse gases.
